I believe strongly in free culture and free-as-in-freedom software. Here are some of my open source projects:

## Recentish

[Wind Toolkit HSDS Examples](https://github.com/NREL/hsds-examples) - Demonstration software and working examples for the
Highly Scalable Data Service (HSDS) front end to the National Renewable Energy Lab's national wind dataset.

[DW TAP Application](https://github.com/NREL/dw-tap-app) - Demonstration React application for the Distributed Wind 
Tools Assessing Performance API and algorithms.

## Ongoing

[Falling Fruit Website](https://github.com/somerandomsequence/falling-fruit) - The source-code behind the non-profit 
website [FallingFruit.org](http://fallingfruit.org), a platform for collaborating on a massive worldwide map
of free food. Now maintained by a group of ~12 hackers.

[Falling Fruit App](https://github.com/falling-fruit/falling-fruit-mobile) - Cordoba based (Android/iOS) mobile application
and frontend for Falling Fruit. Initially funded through a crowdfunding campaign. Currently maintained by a small group of
hackers.

[Food Rescue Robot](http://github.com/somerandomsequence/food-rescue-robot) - Logistics software for tracking decentralized
food recovery. Originally developed for [Boulder Food Rescue](http://boulderfoodrescue.org), now used by a dozen or more 
organizations in cities around the US for managing their operations. Currently maintained by a group of nearly 30 hackers.

[Small White Cube](https://github.com/somerandomsequence/smallwhitecube) - This website :)

## Older Things

[Parallel SSA](https://github.com/somerandomsequence/Parallel-SSA) - Code to perform spatial simulated annealing (SSA) in parallel on a compute cluster. Geared towards optimized sampling for my dissertation research.

[The Second Kitchen](https://github.com/somerandomsequence/tsk-webapp) - Web-based inventory tracking and point-of-sale system for a food buying cooperative in Boulder, Colorado. Now used by an organization in Denver as well.

[Path Loss Research Utilities](/software/pl-software/pl_software_20110912.tar.gz) - A motley collection of useful programs for doing research on path loss models.

[QualNet Hacks](/software/qualnet-hacks/calebs_qualnet_hacks_latest.tar.gz) - Useful hacks and additions for the QualNet 4.5 simulator including EDAM (Effective Directivity Antenna Model).

[Traffic Simulation and Classification Software](/software/traffic-generation/traffic_generation_20090604.tar.gz) - A framework for generating real-as-in-really-real workloads in simulations of infrastructure wireless networks.

[Stochastic Similarity](http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~singh/software/similarity-0.1.tar.gz) - Matlab code to implement the stochastic similarity metric of Nechyba et al..
