My name is Caleb Phillips. I'm a research scientist living in Boulder, Colorado. I am currently employed at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](http://nrel.gov/) in Golden, Colorado. I am also an Assistant Professor Adjunct in the Computer Science Department at the University of Colorado, Boulder and Visiting Research Faculty at Stanford School of Medicine. I did my graduate work on [geostatistical approaches to wireless network coverage mapping](https://encore.colorado.edu/iii/encore/record/C__Rb7463145) with advisers [Doug Sicker](http://spot.colorado.edu/~sicker/) and [Dirk Grunwald](http://systems.cs.colorado.edu/people/faculty/dirk-grunwald/). I've worked in a number of research areas and my primary focus is on applying optimization strategies, parallel computation, and statistical analysis to diverse problems. There's an up to date list of my research activities and academic publications available [here](/research/).

Teaching is another passion. I've taught at the university and high school level, the former as an instructor at the University of Colorado, and the latter as a National Science Foundation fellow designing STEM-oriented curriculum to integrate into traditional education frameworks at [Boulder High School](http://boh.bvsd.org/Pages/default.aspx). I've done work in outdoor garden education with middle schoolers and have designed curriculum to inform science education in the garden. I have a particular affinity for direct mentoring and have had the opportunity to work with a number of excellent students through various programs, including [INVST community studies](http://www.colorado.edu/communitystudies/), the [NSF REU program](http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/), the [Casey Feldman Memorial Foundation](http://www.caseyfeldmanfoundation.org/), the [DOE SULI](https://science.energy.gov/wdts/suli/) program, and the [DOE CSGF](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) program. 

[Small White Cube](http://smallwhitecube.com) is the name of my consulting business, which I founded in June, 2001. I rarely take on new clients, but nevertheless maintain a fairly steady stream of part-time consulting work. I am a co-founder of the 501(c)3 nonprofit organizations [Boulder Food Rescue](http://boulderfoodrescue.org) and [Falling Fruit](http://fallingfruit.org).  Besides Boulder, I've lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago, New Zealand, and briefly in the Khumbu valley in the Nepal Himalaya. I grew up in Portland, Oregon, graduated from Portland State University in 2006, and I worked as a researcher under [Professor Suresh Singh](http://cs.pdx.edu/~singh), after graduation. I was also an active member of the community wireless non-profit, the [Personal Telco Project](http://personaltelco.net) where I was the Director of Education.

When I'm not working, I spend most my waking hours with friends, family, or engaged in one of a large number of homesteady or outdoorsy hobbies. I run, climb, knit, sew, cook, paraglide, brew beer, keep bees, weld, throw pots, bicycle, hike, read, bake, garden, play video games, and take photos.
