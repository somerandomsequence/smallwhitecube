Woohoo. Qualnet Hacks....

Below is a high level description of what's in this tarball. For
more information, look at the top of the individual patch files,
and, worst case, read the source. Apply the patches to the qualnet
source tree as you would expect or as documented in the patch. 
They were mostly generated with "svn diff" and t.f. 
use something like diff -u.

Licensing/authorship is as follows unless stated 
otherwise somewhere else (like in the patch):

  Implements the bounded slowdown powersaving algorithm
  as suggested by Krashinsky and Balakrishnan:
